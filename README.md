# Face-mask-detection
This project detects face masks in real-time using OpenCV and TensorFlow. It leverages MobileNetV2 for mask detection and a DNN for face detection. Faces are labeled "Mask" (green) or "No Mask" (red) based on the prediction. Ideal for monitoring mask compliance in video streams. Press 'q' to quit the stream.
